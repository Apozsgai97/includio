# Includio

Includio is an accessible platform designed to connect clients with businesses based on their accessibility features. It allows users to search for accessible places, add new accessible locations, rate their accessibility, and provide feedback to businesses. Businesses can assess their accessibility, receive improvement suggestions, and notify clients when updates are made.
